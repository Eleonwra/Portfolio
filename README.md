### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Master’s Thesis: Medical NER** | Library, Library | Developed a weakly supervised learning framework to overcome medical data scarcity, using custom heuristics and 3 Transformer architectures to extract Greek clinical entities. |
| **[ElCardioCC (NER) BioASQ 2025 Baseline](https://github.com/Eleonwra/elcardiocc-baseline-ner.git)** | mBERT, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Stanza, Streamlit | Engineered a cardiology dataset by converting raw EHRs (.docx, .txt) into Hugging Face format. Benchmarked multiple tokenizers to integrate Stanza for clinical-grade preprocessing before fine-tuning mBERT. Developed custom PyTorch logic for subword reconstruction, tracked experiments via Weights & Biases, and deployed a real-time Streamlit dashboard. |
