### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
* **[Medical NER System](link)**: Engineered a weakly supervised NLP pipeline using Transformers to extract cardiology entities, reducing manual labeling effort by 90%.
* **[Project Name](link)**: Short one-sentence description of your next AI project.

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Medical NER (BioASQ)](https://github.com/Eleonwra/elcardiocc-baseline-ner.git)** | mBERT, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Stanza, Streamlit | Engineered a cardiology dataset by converting raw EHRs (.docx, .txt) into Hugging Face format. Benchmarked multiple tokenizers to integrate Stanza for clinical-grade preprocessing before fine-tuning mBERT. Developed custom PyTorch logic for subword reconstruction, tracked experiments via Weights & Biases, and deployed a real-time Streamlit dashboard. |
