### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🫀 Master’s Thesis: Medical NER** | Hugging Face, mBERT, XLM-R, GreekBERT, Stanza, Pytorch, W&B | Developed a **semi-supervised framework** for low-resource Greek clinical text by concatenating document-level metadata into model inputs. Engineered the dataset from raw EHRs (.docx, .txt) into HF format and benchmarked tokenizers to integrate Stanza.|
| **[🫀 ElCardioCC (NER) BioASQ 2025 Baseline](https://github.com/Eleonwra/elcardiocc-baseline-ner.git)** | Hugging Face, mBERT, Stanza, PyTorch, W&B, Streamlit | **Official Supervised NER Baseline**. Scaled thesis research into a production-ready model to streamline **clinical coding**.  Developed custom PyTorch logic for subword reconstruction and deployed an inference demo in Streamlit.|
| [💰 **Cost-Sensitive Loan Default Prediction**](https://github.com/Eleonwra/cost-sensitive-ml-for-loan-default-prediction.git) | Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib | Developed a comparative framework to mitigate asymmetric financial risk (1:5 cost ratio). Implemented Hybrid Resampling, Cost-Weighting, and Bayes Risk Minimization across 3 model families to optimize for lowest financial loss rather than global accuracy. |
