### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🫀 Master’s Thesis: Medical NER** | Hugging Face, mBERT, XLM-R, GreekBERT, Stanza, Pytorch, W&B | Engineered a cardiology dataset by converting raw EHRs (.docx, .txt) into Hugging Face format. Developed a **semi-supervised framework** for low-resource Greek clinical text. Improved extraction by **concatenating document-level metadata into model inputs** and utilizing weak supervision to overcome data scarcity |
| **[🫀 ElCardioCC (NER) BioASQ 2025 Baseline](https://github.com/Eleonwra/elcardiocc-baseline-ner.git)** | Hugging Face, mBERT, Stanza, PyTorch, W&B, Streamlit | **Official NER Baseline**. Scaled thesis research into a production-ready model to streamline **clinical coding**. Benchmarked multiple tokenizers to integrate Stanza for clinical-grade preprocessing before fine-tuning mBERT. Developed custom PyTorch logic for subword reconstruction, tracked experiments via Weights & Biases, and deployed a real-time Streamlit dashboard. |
